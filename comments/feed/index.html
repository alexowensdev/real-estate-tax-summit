					<description><![CDATA[The summit has been absolutely amazing and informative! As a real estate broker and investor, I feel so much more prepared now to create strategies based on tax benefits, deductions, and long-term wealth creation formulas. The summit has given me a playbook that I use monthly to pursue my goals, minimize my risk, and maximize my profits. Thank you Mark! You guys are the real deal!
